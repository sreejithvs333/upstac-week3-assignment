#About the Project
This is an assignment project for my master course.

This repo consist of both frontend & backend code for the UPSTAC application.

1. Frontend - upstac-ui (React)
2. Backend - UPSTAC-Week3-assignment (Java Spring boot)

##Frontend

### To run frontend code

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install`

### `yarn start`

##Backend

### To run backend code

The backend code runs simply by running the ‘UpstacApplication.java’ file

### Database

Note: This project uses the default h2 database file which is volatile.
